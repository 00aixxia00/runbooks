# NodeMemoryMajorPagesFaults

## Meaning

Memory major pages are occurring at very high rate at {{ $labels.instance }}, 500 major page faults per second for the last 15 minutes, is currently at {{ printf "%.2f" $value }}.
Please check that there is enough memory available at this instance.

## Impact

The high rate of memory major pages faults indicates potential issues with memory management on the instance, which could lead to degraded performance or even service disruptions.

## Diagnosis

1. **Check Memory Usage**: Review the memory usage statistics on the instance to determine if memory is being exhausted.
2. **Identify Resource-Intensive Processes**: Identify any processes or applications that are consuming large amounts of memory.
3. **Review System Logs**: Check system logs for any error messages related to memory allocation or paging.
4. **Analyze Historical Data**: Review historical metrics data to identify any recent changes or trends in memory usage.
5. **Check for Memory Leaks**: Investigate for any memory leaks in applications running on the instance.

## Mitigation

1. **Increase Memory**: Consider increasing the memory allocation for the instance to provide more resources for applications and processes.
2. **Optimize Applications**: Optimize memory usage within applications to reduce the likelihood of memory exhaustion.
3. **Restart Services**: If possible, restart any services or applications that are consuming excessive memory to free up resources.
4. **Monitor and Tune**: Continuously monitor memory usage and tune system parameters as needed to ensure optimal performance.
5. **Alerting**: Set up alerts to notify administrators when memory usage exceeds certain thresholds to proactively address potential issues.
